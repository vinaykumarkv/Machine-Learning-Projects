***certificate_quality_classifier***
As part of my learning journey, a simple comparision between accuracy measurement between logical rule based code and logistic regression model which since our outcome is either Approve or Reject. (binay classification).
As a beginner freindly project, this is easy to understand model

At first we will be implementing a simple logic to classify the certifciate as approved or rejected based on constraints, the contraints could be different in actual, which could reduce the accuracy of the logic implemented in our code.


Then we will try to split our training data set by 50 % of of our sample data, then try to test remaining 50 % of data to check if our model has higher accuracy in prodicting the outcome.
